# Internet Angryometer - Server
A meter for how the internet is feeling right now. This repository contains the server component.

## About
I decided to build one of those bushfire/avalanche warnings for how angry the internet (twitter) is right now. This project collects the latest tweets and then determines the general mood through NLP - it then updates a page, which in turn updates an arduino component that runs the meter.
